# SPRI Work (USC Cyberinfrastructure Lab)
This is the repository for my SPRI Summer Research Intern Experience project on P4 Programmable Data-Plane switches

Working with Dr. Crichigno and his lab, I developed applications for P4 programmable network switches and a suite of automated tests for packet loss and throughput measurements

### GSSM's SPRI Program

#### From the website
    For six weeks during the summer between junior and senior years, Govies join research groups at universities, businesses, and government agencies across South Carolina, the United States, and the world. Govies work with their research mentors and GSSM faculty during their senior year to complete their research & inquiry portfolio and present at the GSSM Research Colloquium.

### USC Cyberinfrastructure Lab

#### From the website
    The goal of the Cyberinfrastructure (CI) lab is to investigate issues in high-speed networks and Internet of Things (IoT), and to find solutions to the technical problems in these areas. In addition, the CI Lab develops training material for Science demilitarized zones (Science DMZs). The Science DMZ is a network specifically designed to facilitate the transfer and sharing of very large scientific data (big data) across geographically separated sites.
